# Docker Compose Test
Having never used docker compose before and now needing to use it in a project, I think it is prime time to start learning more about compose.  
This is a very basic project ( the one defined on the quickstart page of compose ) meant to just get me up and running with something quick and dirty.  
This is, more than anything, an opportunity to learn. As with all my code, I would like to document this as well. Since this is a very basic project, the docs will exist within this readme.

## Getting Started
- Clone the git repository.
- Open the project folder in a terminal.
- Run `docker compose up`.
- Head to [localhost:8000](https://localhost:8000) or [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1).  
You should see a web page with a hit count, reloading the page should increment the hit count.
